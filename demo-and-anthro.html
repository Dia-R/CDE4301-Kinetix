          <p> For this project, Client refers to stroke patients typically age 40–80 undergoing lower-limb rehabilitation. The term physiotherapist is used broadly to include all rehabilitation specialists, such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</p><!-- USE PARAGRAPH TAG FOR TEXT -->
          <h4> 3.1 Obtaining Lower Limb Dimensions
          </h4> <!-- USE h4 FOR SUBHEADERS -->
          <p> To determine the frame dimensions, key anthropometric parameters of Singaporean adult males and females were referenced from Lee et al. (2019). Lower-limb length was estimated using segments 18 and 22, while foot dimensions were derived from segments 35 and 36 all of which are shown in the illustration below. </p>
