          <p> For this project, Client refers to stroke patients typically age 40–80 undergoing lower-limb rehabilitation. The term physiotherapist is used broadly to include all rehabilitation specialists, such as occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</p><!-- USE PARAGRAPH TAG FOR TEXT -->
          <h4> 3.1 Obtaining Lower Limb Dimensions
          </h4> <!-- USE h4 FOR SUBHEADERS -->
          <p> To determine the frame dimensions, key anthropometric parameters of Singaporean adult males and females were referenced from Lee et al. (2019). Lower-limb length was estimated using segments 18 and 22, while foot dimensions were derived from segments 35 and 36 all of which are shown in the illustration below. </p>

          </figure>
          <p> We then tabulated the combined anthropometric data corresponding to measurements in centimetres for both male and female participants containing the Combined Mean with ± 3 Standard Deviation, accommodating about 99.7% of Singapore’s adult population under a normal distribution (sample size ≈ 100).</p>

          <p> In addition, we also obtained date from a nationally representative data from the Centre for Ageing Research and Education (CARES) at Duke-NUS. These data was derived from the PHASE study of Singaporeans aged 60 and above with cerebrovascular disease (e.g. Stroke), which provided popliteal height measurements corresponding to segment number 18 in the table above. Combining these with Lee et al. (2019) extends the range to better represent the local population including the elderly.</p>

          <h4> 3.2 ROM
          </h4>
          <p> In order to provide a purposeful and comprehensive post stroke rehabilitation, exercises should first restore autonomy in activities of daily living (ADL) before targeting full motion. Kinetix therefore supports both ADL and Full ROM modes. Based on Hyodo et al. (2017), the average joint ranges required for selected ADL are shown in the table below. </p>

          <p> Also, the full ROM values and diagrams for measurement guidelines for the hip, knee, and ankle of the lower limb were obtained using a Range of Joint Motion Evaluation chart used in healthcare services, with the full chart provided in the appendix (Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, 2019).</p>

          <h4> 3.3 Weight 
          </h4>
          <p> Using data from Roystonn (2021), the mean weight of adult male Singaporeans is 72.7 ± 14.4 kg. In consideration of safety, the device is designed to withstand up to 150 kg, or roughly twice the mean weight. Additionally, mean weights and standard deviations for elderly stroke clients (≥65 years) were obtained from PHASE to further validate load requirements. </p>

            <figcaption> Table 6 </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p> To derive segment weights from body weight, data from Ramachandran et al. (2016) presents the percentages as part of the whole body weight of the thigh, calf, and foot. By taking the average of all the different percentages from each investigator, we obtain 10.70%, 4.59%, and 1.68% with a combined percentage of approximately 16.97% for the lower limb.</p>

          </figure>
          <p> Applying this percentage to a 150 kg individual yields an estimated lower limb weight of 25.50 kg, which was used to guide the subsequent mechanical load requirements and the design phase.</p>
