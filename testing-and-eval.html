      <h4>6.1.1 Test Results and Evaluation</h4>
      <p>
        In the FEA simulation, the analysis was performed on the tube where the load is concentrated.
        Assuming the maximum leg weight of 20 kg, where the load is shared between two parallel tubes,
        each tube supports 10 kg, corresponding to approximately 100 N. The results show a minimum factor
        of safety of 28, indicating that the tube would require 28 times the applied load before it begins
        to deform.
      </p>

      <p>
        The arc rail test assessed structural stability under a 9.6 kg load and showed a displacement of
        0.4 mm, indicating potential long-term deformation. The structure connected to the arc rail slider
        was also observed to be slanted, likely due to insufficient support or too small a contact surface,
        which may compromise stability.

      <h4>6.1.2 Shortcomings and Proposal</h4>
      <p>
        For the FEA, additional simulations will be run at different pivot points to further assess stress
        distribution and overall structural performance. After the initial lateral testing, we decided to
        shift the arc rail underneath the linear actuator and structure sub-assembly so that it eliminates
        the deformation.

        An Op-Amp circuit was used for the calibration of each force sensor, as it was the recommended
        circuit by the manufacturer. The equations below are used to guide our chosen values for each
        component and the voltages.

      <p>
        The voltage supply is set to 4.5 V, with the LM324N output kept below 3.3 V for microcontroller
        compatibility. A reference voltage of 0.5 V is generated using a 1:9 voltage divider (R1 = 40 kΩ,
        R2 = 5 kΩ). <br>
        Because the force sensor’s resistance decreases with applied force, a low feedback
        resistor of 2 kΩ is used to maintain sensitivity. The LM324N is expected to produce an output
        range of about 0.5 V to 3.0 V, providing a 2.5 V span for force measurement.

      <h4>6.2.2 Test Shortcomings and Proposals</h4>
      <p>
        Because each A301 force sensor has a small sensing area, initial tests could only use limited
        weights, restricting the range of data for calibration. Future testing will involve the full set
        of plantar sensors on the foot plate, allowing a wider range of loads and improving accuracy.
        A planned test also includes simulating a stepping motion on the foot plate to better reflect
        real usage conditions.

    <h4>6.3.2 Test Results and Evaluation </h4>
    <p>Overall, there were two main tests that were conducted, which were the voltage output verification of the low dropout regulator (LDO) 
      and the motor functionality test for the Nema 23 Stepper Motor.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/Low dropout regulator.png" width="80%">

    <p>The first experiment was set up with the positive terminal connected to the LDO input pin and the ground pin connected to the negative terminal of the DC power supply, 
      which was also tied to ground. A multimeter was then used to measure the voltage drop between the LDO output pin and ground.</p>

    <p>Figure X shows that the LDO performed as expected, consistently outputting approximately 3.3 V with a mean deviation of 3.17 mV (0.096%). This aligns well with the datasheet minimum of 3.267 V, confirming that the LDO is operating correctly and is suitable for integration.

    <p>Figure 49 shows how changing the steps per revolution affects the motor speed, where we can conclude that a lower steps per revolution will allow for a faster motor speed. 
      Thus, allowing us to adjust the horizontal and lateral speed of the device.</p>
