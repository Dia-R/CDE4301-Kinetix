          <h4>6.1.1 Test Results and Evaluation</h4>
          <p> In the FEA simulation, the analysis was performed on the tube where the load is concentrated. Assuming the maximum leg weight of 20 kg, where the load is shared between two parallel tubes, therefore each tube supports 10 kg, corresponding to approximately 100N. 
            The results show a minimum factor of safety of 28, indicating that the tube would require 28 times the applied load before it begins to deform.</p>

          </figure>
          <p> The arc rail test assessed structural stability under a 9.6 kg load and showed a displacement of 0.4 mm, indicating potential long-term deformation. The structure connected to the arc rail slider was also observed to be slanted, likely due to insufficient support or too small a contact surface, which may compromise stability.

          <h4>6.1.2 Shortcomings and Proposal</h4>
          <p> For the FEA, additional simulations will be run at different pivot points to further assess stress distribution and overall structural performance. 
            After the initial lateral testing, we decided to have the arc rail shifted underneath the linear actuator and structure sub-assembly so that it eliminates the deformation. </p>
