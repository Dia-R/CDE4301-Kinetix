        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Abstract</h4>
        <p>In Singapore, stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the seventh leading cause of adult disability (World Stroke Organisation, 2017). This project involves the development of the robotic rehabilitation device, Kinetix, aimed at supporting motor recovery in stroke clients, with a focus on supine (Semi-fowler) position rehabilitation. Kinetix combines mechanical actuation with sensor feedback to assist joint movement, monitor performance, and adapt to individual client needs. It also features an app-based interface for user interaction and progress tracking for both the client and therapist. Control strategies and feedback mechanisms are explored to encourage active engagement to promote recovery. </p>
        <h4>1.2 Background</h4>
        <h4>1.2.1 Types of Strokes</h4>  
        <p>Strokes occur due to either ischaemic or hemorrhagic in nature. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked due to embolism or thrombosis, depriving a region of the brain of blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, involves bleeding in the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel. (Stroke Services Improvement, 2017).</p>

        <h4>1.2.2 Clinical Features of Stroke      </h4> 
        <p>Kinetix considers the motor, cognitive, and psychological features of a stroke in its design, as listed below to provide a summarised description of these clinical features. Features related to motor control and weakness of extremities after stroke not only reduce muscular force generation but also affect the inter-limb coordination of functional movements, or synergies (Darak, 2020). Psychological features demand treatment plans that are sensitive to the emotional states of patients, as well and accessible to patients with cognitive impairment who may require diverse manners of instructions for better outcomes.

        <h4>1.2.3 Stroke Recovery Phases and Assessment
        </h4>
        <p>The diagram below from Marek et al. (2024), shows the phases of post-stroke rehabilitation. To regain neuroplasticity, the “golden time” for rehabilitation is between seven days to 6 months, which spans across the acute and late subacute phases. The table in Appendix D provides the various assessment methods as well as the purpose for post-stroke patients. These established stroke assessments help ensure the device is designed around clinically meaningful and patient-centred outcomes. They highlight the need for accurate tracking of motor performance, spasticity management, and functional improvements, guiding the integration of sensors, adaptive resistance, and task-relevant exercise modes such as activities of daily living (ADL). They also emphasise the importance of user engagement, reinforcing the inclusion of an intuitive, motivating and visually stimulating interface to support recovery.   </p>
