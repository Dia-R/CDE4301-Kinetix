        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Abstract</h4>
        <p>This project presents the development of Kinetix, a robotic rehabilitation device that integrates mechanical actuation with real-time sensor feedback for the rehabilitation of the lower limb in stroke patients. Kinetix facilitates joint movement, monitors performance, and dynamically adapts to each patient. Its app-based interface fosters interactive engagement, enabling both patients and rehabilitation specialists to track recovery in real time. The system further incorporates adaptive control strategies and feedback mechanisms that encourage active participation, supporting a more personalised, efficient, and motivating rehabilitation experience.</p>
        <h4>1.2 Background</h4>
        <p>Stroke remains a major health challenge in Singapore, ranking as the fourth leading cause of death and the seventh leading cause of adult disability [1]. This presents an opportunity for us to contribute to the stroke popualtion in Singapore.</p>
        <h4>1.2.1 Types of Strokes</h4>  
        <p>Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked due to embolism or thrombosis, depriving a region of the brain of blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, involves bleeding in the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel. [2].</p>

        <h4>1.2.2 Clinical Features of Stroke      </h4> 
        <p>Kinetix is designed with key motor, cognitive, and psychological effects of stroke in mind. Motor impairments, such as reduced muscle strength and disrupted inter-limb coordination, shape how patients can perform functional movements. Psychological and cognitive challenges also require therapy that is emotionally sensitive and delivered through varied, accessible forms of instruction. These considerations, outlined in Appendix C, ensure that Kinetix supports stroke patients holistically.

        <h4>1.2.3 Stroke Recovery Phases and Assessment
        </h4>
        <p>The diagram below from Marek et al. (2024) [3], shows the phases of post-stroke rehabilitation. To regain neuroplasticity, the “golden time” for rehabilitation spans across the acute and late subacute phases. The table in Appendix D provides the various assessment methods to help ensure the device is designed around clinically meaningful and patient-centred outcomes. </p>
