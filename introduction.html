        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Abstract</h4>
        <p>In Singapore, stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the seventh leading cause of adult disability (World Stroke Organisation, 2017). This project involves the development of the robotic rehabilitation device, Kinetix, aimed at supporting motor recovery in stroke clients, with a focus on supine (Semi-fowler) position rehabilitation. Kinetix combines mechanical actuation with sensor feedback to assist joint movement, monitor performance, and adapt to individual client needs. It also features an app-based interface for user interaction and progress tracking for both the client and therapist. Control strategies and feedback mechanisms are explored to encourage active engagement to promote recovery. </p>
        <h4>1.2 Background</h4>
        <h4>1.2.1 Types of Strokes</h4>  
        <p>Strokes occur due to either ischaemic or hemorrhagic in nature. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked due to embolism or thrombosis, depriving a region of the brain of blood flow. Hemorrhagic stroke, on the other hand, involves bleeding in the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel. (Stroke Services Improvement, 2017).</p>

        <h4>1.2.2 Clinical Features of Stroke      </h4> 
        <p>Clinical features of stroke include strength deficits, sensory-motor impairment, spasticity, incoordination, and postural dysfunction (Darak, 2020). Impaired motor control and weakness of extremities after stroke not only reduce muscular force generation but also affect the inter-limb coordination of functional movements, or synergies (Darak, 2020). The table below summarises the clinical features.

        <h4>1.2.3 Stroke Recovery Phases and Assessment
        </h4>
        <p>The diagram below references Marek et al. (2024), showing the phases of post-stroke rehabilitation. To regain Neuroplasticity, the “golden time” for rehabilitation is between seven days to 6 months, which spans across the acute and late subacute phase.
