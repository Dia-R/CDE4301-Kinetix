      <h4>4.3 User Journey</h4> <!-- USE h4 FOR SUBHEADERS -->
      <p>An in-person interview with a physiotherapist from S3 allowed us to map a detailed client–therapist user journey across the rehabilitation session. This helped us understand real clinical workflows and design the system to better fit the actual context of use, improving overall user experience.</p>

      <h4>4.4 Mechanical Design</h4> <!-- USE h4 FOR SUBHEADERS -->

      <h4><i>4.4.1 Design Inspiration</i></h4>
      <p>The device uses a motor-driven ball screw to create linear motion along an aluminum profile, which is transferred through a linkage system to produce controlled angular movement of the footrest for simulating lower-limb flexion and extension. However, several issues were identified: many components are difficult to fabricate, custom rod assemblies limit part interchangeability, the frame lacks structural rigidity, and the CPM-based design only supports passive motion, preventing active or resistive rehabilitation.</p>

      <p>With a clear concept of the device, we developed Version 0 of the prototype using OEM standard parts to support six exercise types. This design features a lower-limb actuation system driven by a linear actuator on a ball screw, where the moving carriage converts rotational motion into linear displacement. A parallel multi-link mechanism with rods and rotary joints transfers this motion to the foot interface, producing coordinated, smooth angular movement that mimics natural leg flexion and extension.</p>

      <h4><i>4.4.2 Design Concepts</i></h4>
      <p>For the second prototype in Semester 2, interviews with physiotherapists indicated that the device should support both sitting and lying positions. Based on this, the team developed three design concepts reflecting these two modes of use.</p>

      <p>Several mechanisms could provide linear motion, including rack-and-pinion systems, ball screw actuators, and pneumatic actuators. We selected a ball screw linear actuator due to its relative simplicity. A comparison table was created to evaluate each option in terms of reliability, maintenance, mechanical complexity, and user ergonomics.</p>

      <p>We adopted an arc rail mechanism to meet our design requirements, building on the initial concept developed by our UROP predecessor. To address shortcomings in their design, we repositioned the arc rail from above the linear nut to beneath the linear sub-assembly.</p>

      <h4><i>4.4.4.1 Lateral Frame Mechanism</i></h4>
      <p>The lateral movement is driven by a Nema 23 motor mounted at the rear of the assembly, with a swappable placement for easy maintenance. Power is transmitted through a belt-and-pulley system, chosen for its light weight and ease of installation compared to gear or chain mechanisms.</p>

      <h4>4.5 Sensing Design Concepts</h4>
      <p>This section explains three different design concepts for the sensing subsystem in terms of their working principle and evaluation through a comparison matrix. All raw data will be transmitted to a processor, where signal noise will be filtered out for further analysis.</p>

      <h4><i>4.5.1 FIMU Design Concept</i></h4>
      <p>The IMU subsystem combines an accelerometer, gyroscope, and optionally a magnetometer to measure motion and angular velocity across three axes, enabling analysis of hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematics. This concept employs a four-IMU setup (lower back, thigh, shank, and foot).</p>

      <p>The force sensor setup targets key pressure points on the foot: hallux, metatarsals, midfoot, and heels (Guevara et al., 2024). For medial-lateral force sensing, additional sensors are placed near the medial and lateral malleoli to measure forces during hip adduction and abduction, following hip dynamometry assessment protocols (Thorborg et al., 2010).</p>

      <h4><i>4.5.2 Hall-Force-Flex (HFF) Design Concept</i></h4>
      <p>The HFF subsystem combines Hall-effect sensors, force sensors, and flex sensors to capture biomechanical data during lower-limb rehabilitation exercises for stroke clients. These sensors are positioned at key regions of the lower limb to track motion and loading across multiple planes of movement. Force sensor placement in the HFF is similar to that of the FIMU design concept.</p>

      <h4><i>4.5.3 Computer Vision Design Concept</i></h4>
      <p>A computer vision sensor uses an RGB camera and pose-estimation algorithms to track 3D joint positions (e.g., hip, knee, ankle) and compute joint angles from relative body segment orientations. Markers are placed on key joints (torso, hip, knee, ankle, and foot tip), and the client’s movements. The video is then processed using Tracker Software to determine marker positions and calculate joint angles.</p>

                The FlexiForce A301 was selected for the plantar force sensing subsystem due to its 
                lower cost, shorter lead time, and ability to meet the required 0–1000 N (plantar) 
                and 0–200 N (lateral) force ranges. Although it has a smaller sensing area (9.53 mm), 
                this is compensated by load-concentrating pucks for accurate readings at key foot 
                regions. Its circular shape also conforms better to anatomical surfaces than 
                rectangular alternatives, making it a cost-effective and anatomically compatible choice.

                The GY-85 IMU was chosen for its reliable 9-DOF setup (gyro, accelerometer, and

                suitable for a four-IMU lower-limb configuration. The GY-91 adds unnecessary 
                sensors and cost, while the LSM9DS1 sacrifices voltage flexibility. Validated 
                against the Motive-OptiTrack system, the GY-85 shows joint-angle errors under 6° 
                (max 12°) across a 0°–150° ROM, providing clinically acceptable accuracy 
                (Manupibul, 2023).

      <h4>4.6 Mechanical Design</h4>
      <p>With mechanical subsystems finalised, the electrical design phase can begin. For motor selection, the maximum torque that the screw bar can resist before backdriving must be determined to guide motor choice (Collins, n.d.). Using a 150 kg load and a 10 mm screw lead, the calculated backdriving torque is 2.15 Nm. Hence, the selected motors must have a holding torque ≥ 2.15 Nm to ensure reliable operation.</p>

      <p>The stepper motor was selected for its high torque at low speeds and ability to maintain stable fixed positions, ideal for active mode, where users must overcome a preset force threshold to move the motor without backdriving. Its simple open-loop control avoids issues like jitter found in closed-loop systems under static loads. The chosen motor, a Nema 23 Bipolar Stepper Motor, provides a holding torque of 3.0 Nm, exceeding the 2.15 Nm backdriving torque requirement.</p>

      <h4>4.7.2 Microcontroller Selection</h4>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi Pico W2 was chosen as the device’s microcontroller unit (MCU) for its strong price-to-performance ratio, compact size, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Despite costing only S$9.62, it offers processing speed and memory comparable to higher-end options like the Teensy 4.1 (S$50–58). Its small footprint minimizes device size and leaves room for other components, while integrated wireless connectivity reduces costs and wiring complexity.</p>

      <h4>4.8 UI Design Concepts</h4>
      <p>The first design concepts featured a two-view approach such that both physiotherapists and clients can use the User Interface, according to the first iteration of user flow diagram below.</p>

      <p>Feedback on the first UI showed the need for a therapist-focused interface, removal of unnecessary calendar/logging features, and inclusion of gamification to motivate clients. These insights informed a revised user flow with five clear stages and a rotated “During Session” display for client feedback and gamified elements.</p>
