          <h4>4.4 Mechanical Design</h4> <!-- USE h4 FOR SUBHEADERS -->

          <h4><i>4.4.1 Design Inspiration</i></h4>
          <p>The device uses a ball screw conveyor driven by a motor to provide linear motion along the aluminum profile. The base plate moves linearly as the screw rotates, transferring motion to Rod 2, which connects to the footrest through mechanical links and rod ends. As the base plate slides, the linkage system converts the linear motion into controlled angular movement of the footrest, simulating lower-limb flexion and extension. </p>

            <figcaption> Figure 13</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Several pain points were identified in this design. Firstly, many components are difficult to fabricate, increasing production complexity and cost. Additionally, the design relies on custom rod assemblies rather than standard OEM parts, limiting interchangeability and ease of maintenance. The overall structure is also not sufficiently sturdy, as the main frame supporting the legs consists of only a few rods, compromising stability and durability. Lastly, the design is heavily based on a Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) concept, which restricts functionality to passive movement and does not accommodate active or resistive rehabilitation modes.</p>
          <h4><i>4.4.2 Design Concepts</i></h4>
          <p>Later on, we proposed 3 different modes based on our preliminary research on the exercise video conducted by SGH ( SingHealth, 2011).</p>
          <figure> <!-- USE FIGURE TAG BEFORE ADDING IMAGES -->

            <figcaption> Figure 14</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>After further discussion with our industrial partner, it agreed that we will be only focused on implementing 2 modes which are linear and lateral exercise. From this discussion we created a rough design to better understand how the device would look like.</p>

            <img src = "images/profile/Introduction/BWSTT.png" width = "80%"> <!-- DO NOT CHANGE WIDTH UNLESS NECESSARY, UPLOAD IMAGES TO RELEVANT FOLDER AND RIGHT CLICK IMAGE FOR CORRECT RELATIVE PATH, THEN COPY PASTE-->
            <figcaption> Figure 15</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>After we gained a better idea on how the device would look like, we incorporated OEM standard parts on our version 0 of the prototype, to execute up to 6 different exercises. This design depicts a mechanical lower-limb actuation prototype driven by a linear actuator along a ball screw assembly. The linear carriage translates along the base, converting rotational motion from the screw into linear displacement. Attached to the carriage is a multi-link mechanism composed of parallel rods and rotary joints, which transmit motion to the foot interface at the upper end. The linkage system enables coordinated angular movement resembling the natural flexion and extension of the leg, while maintaining smooth and stable motion through its parallel configuration.</p>

          </figure>

          <h4><i>4.4.2.1 Folding Concept</i></h4>
          <p>After our conducted interviews with physiotherapist, we concluded that the device would be more beneficial if it has two modes of usage which are sitting and laying down position. Our team made 3 design concepts based on this two modes idea.</p>
          <p><u>Concept 1 - Stand Design</u></p>

            <figcaption> Figure 19</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>By tabulating the comparisons of the design concepts based on our several matrices, we concluded the foldable concept is the most suitable for us. This idea will be the future work of our group for the upcoming semester.</p>
          
          <h4><i>4.4.3 Linear Movement</i></h4>
          <p>There are many mechanical options for the linear motions such as rack and pinion system, ball screw linear actuator, pneumatic actuator, etc. We decided to choose a ball screw linear actuator since it's the simplest mechanism compared to other options. We tabulated the result comparing the mechanism in terms of reliability, maintenance, and mechanical complexity, and user ergonomics.</p>

          </figure>

          <h4><i>4.4.4 Lateral Movement</i></h4>
          <p>Based on our specification requirement, the device has to be able to move 40° in both left and right direction. We evaluate the criteria requirement of our system based on matrices mentioned below.</p>
          <p>With this idea in mind, we decided the arc rail mechanism would be suitable for our design requirement. This idea was implemented by our UROP counterpart that worked on the initial version of this device. Looking at UROP’s design shortcoming we swapped the arc rail position from the top of the linear nut to underneath the linear sub assembly.</p>

          </figure>

          <h4><i>4.4.4.1 Lateral Frame Mechanism</i></h4>
          <p>The lateral movement is powered by a Nema 23 motor connected at the back of the assemblies. The motor placement is designed to be swappable for maintenance purposes with the screws easily accessible.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>The motor is connected with a belt and pulley system. The main reason we opted for this configuration is that the belt is light weight and can be mounted easily compared to other power transferring mechanisms such as gear and chain systems.</p>

          <h4>4.5 Sensing Design Concepts</h4>
          <p>This section explains three different design concepts for the sensing subsystem in terms of their working principle and evaluation through a comparison matrix. All raw data will be transmitted to a processor, where signal noise will be filtered out for further analysis.</p>
          <h4><i>4.5.1 FIMU (Force + Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)) Design Concept</i></h4>
          <p>The IMU subsystem combines an accelerometer, gyroscope, and optionally a magnetometer to measure motion and angular velocity across three axes, enabling analysis of hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematics. While gait analysis systems often use up to nine sensors, this concept employs a simpler four-IMU setup (lower back, thigh, shank, and foot), sufficient for single-limb rehabilitation./p>

            <figcaption> Figure 32</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The force sensor setup targets key pressure points on the foot—hallux, metatarsals, midfoot, and heels—mirroring the layout of commercial systems like the MatScan Pressure Mat (Guevara et al., 2024). For medial-lateral force sensing, additional sensors are placed near the medial and lateral malleoli to measure forces during hip adduction and abduction, following hip dynamometry assessment protocols (Thorborg et al., 2010).</p>

          <h4><i>4.5.2 Hall-Force-Flex (HFF) Design Concept</i></h4>
          <P>The HFF subsystem combines Hall-effect sensors, force sensors, and flex sensors to capture biomechanical data during lower-limb rehabilitation exercises for stroke clients. These sensors are positioned at key regions of the lower limb to track motion and loading across multiple planes of movement. The diagram illustrates possible placement zones, serving as a guide rather than an exact indication of the number and precise location of sensors required in each region, both of which are subject to the mechanical design of Kinetix. Force sensor placement in the HFF is similar to that of the FIMU design concept.</P>

            <figcaption> Figure 33</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h4><i>4.5.3 Computer Vision Design Concept</i></h4>
          <p>A computer vision sensor uses an RGB camera and pose-estimation algorithms to track 3D joint positions (e.g., hip, knee, ankle) and compute joint angles from relative body segment orientations. Its key advantages are practicality, cost-efficiency, and non-intrusiveness, as it requires no physical sensors and can operate with a simple camera in real-world settings. However, its accuracy declines for non-sagittal or obstructed movements and is sensitive to camera placement and angle, limiting precision in complex motion analysis (Wang et al., 2021). In this method, markers are placed on key joints (torso, hip, knee, ankle, and foot tip), and the client’s movements are recorded in 2D. The video is then processed using Tracker Software to determine marker positions and calculate joint angles.</p>

          <h4>4.6  UI-UX Design Concepts</h4>
          <p>Initial design concepts featured a two-view approach such that both physiotherapists and clients can use the User Interface, according to the first iteration of user flow diagram below.</p>
                    <figure> <!-- USE FIGURE TAG BEFORE ADDING IMAGES -->

            <figcaption> Figure 36</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>However, feedback on the first UI concept highlights the need for a simpler, therapist-driven interface without too many complex features. Additionally, gamification was suggested in order to motivate clients. Calendar or logging features are unnecessary in clinical settings and should be replaced with a progress/goals dashboard. Taking this feedback into account, the following software user flow was created, along with the second iteration of the application. The diagram illustrates the overall therapist–client interaction sequence within the Kinetix application. The interface is divided into five color-coded stages in accordance to the user journey: Start/End (green), Decision (purple), Pre-Session (blue), During Session (yellow), and Post-Session (pink), where during the yellow “During Session” phase, the tablet is rotated towards the client to display progress and visual cues in real time.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>The use of gaming technologies provides an engaging and effective interactive approach for stroke rehabilitation, particularly during repetitive motion exercises. Key features to include in serious rehabilitation games are mechanisms that promote challenge and allow recovery from errors, such as point systems that reward effort rather than the degree of physical recovery (Mubin et al.). The target-based animations also serve as important neuromotor cues to guide muscle activation in the patient and signal the completion of reps, which improves motor learning (Guillermo, 2016). This design was also presented to Industrial Transformation ASIA-PACIFIC (ITAP), where the Minister of Transport could appreciate the concepts of gamification.</p>

          <h4>4.7  Electrical Design</h4>
          <p>With mechanical subsystems finalised, the electrical design phase can begin. It involves evaluating suitable motors for active and passive modes, and selecting an appropriate microcontroller unit (MCU) for data processing and control. Before motor selection, the maximum torque that the screw bar can resist before backdriving must be determined to guide motor choice (Collins, n.d.).</p>
          <figure> <!-- USE FIGURE TAG BEFORE ADDING IMAGES -->
            <img src = "images/profile/Introduction/BWSTT.png" width = "80%"> <!-- DO NOT CHANGE WIDTH UNLESS NECESSARY, UPLOAD IMAGES TO RELEVANT FOLDER AND RIGHT CLICK IMAGE FOR CORRECT RELATIVE PATH, THEN COPY PASTE-->
            <figcaption> Figure 38</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Using a 150 kg load and a 10 mm screw lead, the calculated backdriving torque is 2.15 Nm. Hence, the selected motors must have a holding torque ≥ 2.15 Nm to ensure safe and reliable operation.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>Figure 8 provides a brief description of the motor types that we have considered for our device. Starting with Brushed DC Motor, its simple design meant that it is inexpensive but suffers from a short lifespan due to mechanical friction and noise. Hence, they are usually used in small toys and robotics. In contrast, BLDC offers greater efficiency and longer service life, thereby making them ideal for high-performance applications (Millett, n.d.; Seeed Studio, 2018). 
            Meanwhile, Servo Motors have two sub-categories, which are positional and continuous rotation servos. The former has limited range of motion, but compensates it with excellent precision control due to its self-locking mechanism. However, the latter allows for unrestricted rotation, but lacks the capability of its counterpart to maintain a static position. Thus, positional servos are often used for camera stabilisation, whereas continuous rotation servos are mainly seen in robotic joints for smooth movement (Maeschke, 2023).
            Lastly, Stepper Motors have excellent torque at static positions and low speeds which is a result of its multiple poles design. Therefore, they are ideal for applications in holding heavy loads and maintaining a position such as a camera slider. Unfortunately, they are inefficient as they continuously draw a large current to maintain a position, often requiring cooling to prevent overheating (Seeed Studio, 2018; Tang, 2021).</p>
          <h4><i>4.7.2 Motor Evaluation</i></h4>

            <figcaption> Figure 40</figcaption>
          </figure>     
          <p>The stepper motor was selected for its high torque at low speeds and ability to maintain stable fixed positions, ideal for active mode, where users must overcome a preset force threshold to move the motor without backdriving. Its simple open-loop control avoids issues like jitter found in closed-loop systems under static loads. The chosen motor, a Nema 23 Bipolar Stepper Motor, provides a holding torque of 3.0 Nm, exceeding the 2.15 Nm backdriving torque requirement.</p>

            <figcaption> Figure 41</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <P>The Raspberry Pi Pico W2 was chosen as the device’s microcontroller unit (MCU) for its strong price-to-performance ratio, compact size, and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Despite costing only S$9.62, it offers processing speed and memory comparable to higher-end options like the Teensy 4.1 (S$50–58). Its small footprint minimizes device size and leaves room for other components, while integrated wireless connectivity reduces costs and wiring complexity.</P>

          <h4><i>4.7.4 Simplified Electrical Schematic</i></h4>
          <p>With the motor type and MCU selected, we can now create a simplified electrical schematic for the whole device.</p>

          <p>Figure 27 shows the first part of the simplified electrical schematic where the power source of the device originates from the wall plug with a 230 V and 50 Hz power rating. An AC to DC power adapter cable would then be used to rectify the power to DC for the motor in Figure 28. Meanwhile, for the other components, it will need to be stepped down to 5 V using a DC-DC Buck Converter for the MCU, and further stepped down to 3.3 V for the sensors as seen in Figure 29. In terms of communication protocol, only the IMU will utilise I2C, while the other peripherals will use the standard GPIO and analog-to-digital communication protocol.</p>

This will be the main user interface that the physiotherapist will use to configure the patient’s exercise.</p>
