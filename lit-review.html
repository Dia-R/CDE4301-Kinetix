          <h3>2. Literature Review</h3>
      
          <p>This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing approaches to lower extremity rehabilitation in stroke clients, including both traditional and device-assisted rehabilitation, for the purpose of identifying a value proposition, user needs and determining the design concept of a novel rehabilitation device. 
          </p>
          <h4>2.1 Challenges in Stroke Rehabilitation of Lower Extremities
          </h4>
          <p>Fatigue is a common outcome post-stroke; the robot rehabilitation device aims to reduce mental load and encourage recovery (Sithamparapillai, 2022). Lower extremity rehabilitation, especially for gait recovery, can require significant time and physical effort from physiotherapists. Physiotherapists also report high rates of burnout due to long hours and proximity to clients, an area in which the device can address (Nair, 2023). Another study examining challenges faced by physiotherapists during lower limb prosthesis rehabilitation reported that 81.5% of physiotherapists encountered "high physical demand" as a major challenge (Chi, 2022).

          <h4>2.2 Rehabilitation Methods
          </h4>
          <p>
            Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) is a manual therapy widely used to improve balance and mobility in stroke clients, particularly effective during the acute and subacute recovery phases for neuromuscular re-education and motor function restoration (Li, 2022; Nguyen, 2022). It involves therapist-guided, multi-planar movements that mimic functional tasks. In contrast, robotic rehabilitation systems—including exoskeletons, BWSTT with DGOs, and end-effector devices—focus on gait restoration but are typically applied only during late subacute and chronic stages of recovery.
