          <h3>2. Literature Review on Stroke Rehabilitation Background and Treatment Methods
          </h3>
      
          <p>This section aims to provide a comprehensive overview of existing approaches to lower extremity rehabilitation in stroke patients, including both traditional and device-assisted rehabilitation, to identify a value proposition, user needs, and determine the design concept of a novel rehabilitation device.    </p>
          <h4>2.1 Challenges in Stroke Rehabilitation of Lower Extremities
          </h4>
          <p>Lower-limb rehabilitation places substantial physical and time demands on physiotherapists. This burden contributes to high levels of burnout, with physiotherapists reporting stress from long working hours and the physically intensive nature of hands-on therapy (Nair, 2023). 81.5% of physiotherapists identified “high physical demand” as a major challenge in their practice (Chi, 2022). These challenges highlight the need for assistive rehabilitation technologies that can reduce therapist workload while sustaining patient engagement and recovery outcomes.
          </p>
          <h4>2.2 Rehabilitation Methods
          </h4>
          <p>
            Stroke rehabilitation commonly combines manual therapeutic techniques and robotic-assisted systems, each serving different stages of recovery. One widely used manual approach is Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF), which promotes neuromuscular re-education and motor function restoration through therapist-guided, multi-planar movements that mimic real-life tasks. PNF is particularly effective in the acute and subacute phases, when patients require hands-on facilitation to regain balance, coordination, and mobility (Li, 2022; Nguyen, 2022). Another device that is also used in the in the early stages of stroke recovery is the Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) machine. CPM machine offers continuous and repetitive motion that promotes neuroplasticity which leads to positive outcomes in post-stroke rehabilitation (Ripin, Z. B. M., 2018).    
          </p>
          <p> In contrast, robotic rehabilitation systems, such as exoskeletons, Body Weight–Supported Treadmill Training (BWSTT) with Device-Guided Orthoses (DGO), and end-effector devices, primarily support gait retraining and are more commonly introduced in the late subacute to chronic stages. These systems provide repetitive, task-specific movement training aimed at improving walking ability and functional independence.

          </figure>
          <h4>2.3 Shortcomings of current rehabilitation methods    </h4>
          <p>Despite their benefits, both manual, CPM and robotic approaches face significant limitations. Manual techniques such as PNF, while effective, lack standardised outcome tracking and depend strongly on therapist skill and consistency. This results in variability in treatment quality and limited long-term data for monitoring progress.</p>
        <p>
          CPM lacks although results in positive neuroplasticity outcomes lacks active resistance motion (ARM) which stems from the engagement of muscles. ARM has been proven effective in post-storoke rehabilitaion because it leads to an increase in range of motion (ROM) (Indrawati, I., & Sajidin, M. , 2018). BWSTT and DGO systems assist with joint movement but still rely heavily on physiotherapist support in early rehabilitation, limiting scalability and increasing therapist workload. End-effector devices have shown positive outcomes, particularly when combined with conventional therapy, but are less suitable for patients in the early stages for those restricted to supine and semi-flower exercises, as they require partial body-weight support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, current robotic systems have yet to fully leverage their potential for data-driven rehabilitation; although capable of capturing precise kinematic and kinetic measurements, these insights are not routinely used to personalise therapy or enhance motor learning. Collectively, these gaps highlight the need for accessible, standardised, and data-integrated rehabilitation solutions that support the acute and late subacute recovery, reduce therapist load, and enable meaningful progress tracking. While traditional rehabilitation has been a long-established tool for neuromuscular recovery, literature review asserts that it is unsustainable for many physiotherapists due to high workloads, high physiotherapist-to-patient ratio and limited frequency and consistency. CPM machines also have their limitations such as lack of ARM and providing only linear motion of the lower limb.   </p>
     
     <p> While robotic systems like BWSTT and DGO address these limitations by reducing labour and providing repeatable, consistent movements, these systems are lacking in their ability to collect and process sensor-based feedback for objective progress tracking, treat patients who require supine or semi-Fowler recovery, and are often costly compared to manual rehabilitation.</p>

<h4>2.5 Value Proposition </h4>
<p>Unlike conventional systems that are bulky, costly, or limited in movement, Kinetix enables both passive and active resistive exercises, including lateral hip motion, in a supine and semi-Fowler position with real-time joint-angle and force tracking. By reducing therapists’ physical workload and expanding therapeutic options, Kinetix enhances treatment efficiency and clinical outcomes. Its interactive, gamified tablet interface keeps patients engaged and motivated while providing adaptive feedback and data-driven insights for therapists. Designed for community rehabilitation centres, Kinetix delivers scalable, high-quality therapy and saves hospitals an estimated S$25,000–30,000 annually per device through reduced manpower demands and higher treatment throughput which reference to Appendix A.</p>
        
<b>The value proposition is a portable, data-driven rehabilitation solution that empowers therapists, motivates patients through interactive gamification, and supports comprehensive lower-limb recovery, offering both clinical and economic value to healthcare providers.</b>
